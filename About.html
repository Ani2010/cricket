<h3>What is Cricket?</h3>
Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.When ten players have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles.
<h3>How is it played? </h3>
The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player (so they are "out").
<h3>Means of dismissal</h3>
<table  width="800px" border ="1">
<tr>
<th>Dismissed as</th>
<th>What happens</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1. Bowled</td>
<td>When a batsman misses the ball(bowled by the bowler)and it hits the stumps with which the bails too have to fall</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. Catch Out</td>
<td>When a batsman hits the ball and a fielder catches it, without the ball touching the ground</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. LBW (Leg Before Wicket)</td>
<td>When the ball hits a batsman's leg(only if ball was going to hit the stumps if leg wasn't there)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. Stumped</td>
<td>When a batsman misses the ball and the wicket keeper catches it and hits it on the stumps(only occurs if batsman is out of the crese)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5. Hit Wicket</td>
<td>When a batsman himself/herself hits the stumps and the bails fall down</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6. Run Out</td>
<td> When batsmans run between the wickets to take runs and one fielder throws the ball on the stumps and the bails fall before the batsman reaches inside the crese</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7. Timed Out</td>
<td>It occurs when an incoming batsman is not ready to play within three minutes of the previous batsman being out (It is very rare to be out in such a fashion, and has never occurred in any international match)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8. Handled the ball</td>
<td>If the batsman intentionally touched the ball to prevent getting injured/geting out(Handled the ball was formerly one of the methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket, but was integrated into the Law on obstructing the field when the Laws of Cricket were rewritten in 2017)</td>
